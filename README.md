# url_shortener
a simple url shortener service written in Go

## Stack

- web framework: `Fiber`
- DB: `PostgreSQL`
- DB toolchain: `migrate`, `sqlc`
- Container/Orchestration: Docker/Docker compose

## Thoughts

- I chose `Fiber` and `sqlc` because in another showcase project `secumon` I have
used `Gin` and `Gorm`. It is to show that I can adapt with different tools
based on the existent project setup.
